				<h1>French Quarter Festival Redesign</h1>
				<p>French Quarter Festivals, Inc is a non-profit organization who's goal has always been to contribute to the economy of the French Quarter, by providing free entertainment for locals and tourists to explore the city. The French Quarter Festival started in 1984 as a "showcase" for New Orleans’ finest local musicians. Since then, it has grown into the cities second largest festival, which represents the best of local culture, food, music, film, and visual art. This festival truly embodies the unique and diverse culture of the French Quarter in New Orleans and provides an amazing opportunity to support local artists and keep communities and the world connected to this city.</p>
				<p>In its current state, this website is difficult to navigate and is lacking in a "system" that would create more ease for festival attendees, especially people unfamiliar with the city. Based on competitor research, the site and brand feel outdated and do not represent the pride and culture that people associate with this city and event. Because this is such a large event and brings so much tourism to New Orleans, it would benefit from having a unique brand and website, separate from the non-profit "umbrella" it is currently in.</p>
				<p>My goal for this site was to make it accessible to multiple generations and locals and tourists alike; with a better organized site navigation and emphasis on event schedules and locations, As well as giving it a more contemporary feel, with an emphasis on New Orleans culture and heritage without looking “historical”.</p>

				<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
