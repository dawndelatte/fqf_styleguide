# fqf_styleguide

This is a style guide for my final project at The Iron Yard. 
For my final project, I did a redesign for The French Quarter Festival website. 
This style guide enforces standards for logo usage, image edited and saving, color, typography, grid system and other elements.
It also documents all of my process, from research and discovery to live coded website.
