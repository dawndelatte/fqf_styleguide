# French Quarter Festival Style Guide

This is a style guide for my final project at The Iron Yardâ€”a redesign for The French Quarter Festival website. 
This style guide enforces standards for logo usage, image editing and saving, color, typography, grid system and other elements.
It also documents all of my process, from research and discovery to live coded website.
